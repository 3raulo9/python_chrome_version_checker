# Chrome Version Checker

This application provides a simple way to check the version of Google Chrome installed on a Windows machine by accessing the Windows Registry. Knowing the Chrome version is particularly useful for ensuring compatibility when downloading the correct version of ChromeDriver, which is essential for web scraping with Selenium.

## Why Check Chrome Version?

When working with Selenium for web scraping or browser automation, it is crucial to match the version of ChromeDriver with the installed version of Google Chrome. Mismatched versions can lead to errors and unexpected behavior in your automation scripts.

## Usage

To check the installed version of Google Chrome, simply run the script. The script will output the version of Chrome if it is installed, or indicate that Chrome is not installed if it cannot find the relevant registry key.
